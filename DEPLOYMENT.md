# Project K - Static Deployment Guide

Project K has been configured for **client-side rendering** with static export to minimize server costs and enable deployment to any static hosting service.

## 🚀 Quick Deployment

### 1. Build the Static Files
```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an `out/` directory with all static files.

### 2. Deploy to Static Hosting

**Option A: Netlify**
- Drag and drop the `out/` folder to [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop)
- Or connect your Git repository and set build command to `npm run build`

**Option B: Vercel**
```bash
npx vercel --prod
```

**Option C: GitHub Pages**
- Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
- Set source to GitHub Actions
- Use the provided GitHub Actions workflow

**Option D: AWS S3 + CloudFront**
- Upload `out/` contents to S3 bucket
- Configure S3 for static website hosting
- Set up CloudFront for CDN

## ⚙️ Environment Variables

Make sure to set these environment variables in your hosting provider:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

**Important:** All environment variables must be prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` for client-side access.

## 🧪 Local Testing

Test the static build locally:
```bash
npm run serve
```

This serves the `out/` directory on http://localhost:3000

## 📦 What's Included in the Build

- ✅ All pages pre-rendered as static HTML
- ✅ Optimized JavaScript bundles
- ✅ CSS compiled and minified  
- ✅ Assets optimized and copied
- ✅ Service worker ready (if needed)

## 🔧 Build Configuration

The app is configured with:
- `output: 'export'` - Enables static export
- `images: { unoptimized: true }` - Required for static export
- `trailingSlash: true` - Consistent routing

## 💰 Cost Benefits

**Before (SSR):** Requires server resources, scaling costs
**After (CSR):** Zero server costs, only hosting costs

### Hosting Cost Examples:
- **Netlify/Vercel:** Free tier available
- **GitHub Pages:** Free for public repos
- **AWS S3:** ~$1-5/month for most traffic
- **Cloudflare Pages:** Free tier available

## 🌟 Performance Notes

- Initial page load includes full React bundle
- Subsequent navigation is instant (SPA behavior)
- All data fetching happens client-side via Supabase
- Perfect for authenticated dashboard applications

## 🔄 Deployment Workflow

1. Make changes to your code
2. Test locally: `npm run dev`
3. Build static files: `npm run build`
4. Test static build: `npm run serve`
5. Deploy `out/` directory to your hosting service

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**Build fails?**
- Check environment variables are set
- Run `npm run lint` to fix linting issues

**Pages not loading?**
- Ensure all pages have `'use client'` directive
- Check browser console for errors

**Supabase connection issues?**
- Verify environment variables in hosting provider
- Check Supabase project settings and RLS policies
